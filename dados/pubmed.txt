TI  - Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy: A Systematic Narrative Review of the Literature.
PG  - 1691-1706
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S360733 [doi]
AB  - Currently, ketamine is used in treating multiple pain, mental health, and 
      substance abuse disorders due to rapid-acting analgesic and antidepressant 
      effects. Its limited short-term durability has motivated research into the 
      potential synergistic actions between ketamine and psychotherapy to sustain 
      benefits. This systematic review on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) 
      summarizes existing evidence regarding present-day practices. Through rigorous 
      review, seventeen articles that included 603 participants were identified. From 
      available KAP publications, it is apparent that combined treatments can, in 
      specific circumstances, initiate and prolong clinically significant reductions in 
      pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, while encouraging rapport and treatment 
      engagement, and promoting abstinence in patients addicted to other substances. 
      Despite much variance in how KAP is applied (route of ketamine administration, 
      ketamine dosage/frequency, psychotherapy modality, overall treatment length), 
      these findings suggest psychotherapy, provided before, during, and following 
      ketamine sessions, can maximize and prolong benefits. Additional large-scale 
      randomized control trials are warranted to understand better the mutually 
      influential relationships between psychotherapy and ketamine in optimizing 
      responsiveness and sustaining long-term benefits in patients with chronic pain. 
      Such investigations will assist in developing standardized practices and 
      maintenance programs.

TI  - At-home, sublingual ketamine telehealth is a safe and effective treatment for 
      moderate to severe anxiety and depression: Findings from a large, prospective, 
      open-label effectiveness trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At-home Ketamine-assisted therapy (KAT) with psychosocial support and 
      remote monitoring through telehealth platforms addresses access barriers, 
      including the COVID-19 pandemic. Large-scale evaluation of this approach is 
      needed for questions regarding safety and effectiveness for depression and 
      anxiety. METHODS: In this prospective study, a large outpatient sample received 
      KAT over four weeks through a telehealth provider. Symptoms were assessed using 
      the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized 
      Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics, adverse events, and 
      patient-reported dissociation were also analyzed. Symptom trajectories were 
      identified using Growth Mixture Modeling, along with outcome predictors. RESULTS: 
      A sample of 1247 completed treatment with sufficient data, 62.8 % reported a 50 % 
      or greater improvement on the PHQ-9, d = 1.61, and 62.9 % on the GAD-7, d = 1.56. 
      Remission rates were 32.6 % for PHQ-9 and 31.3 % for GAD-7, with 0.9 % 
      deteriorating on the PHQ-9, and 0.6 % on the GAD-7. Four patients left treatment 
      early due to side effects or clinician disqualification, and two more due to 
      adverse events. Three patient subpopulations emerged, characterized by 
      Improvement (79.3 %), Chronic (11.4 %), and Delayed Improvement (9.3 %) for PHQ-9 
      and GAD-7. Endorsing side effects at Session 2 was associated with delayed 
      symptom improvement, and Chronic patients were more likely than the other two 
      groups to report dissociation at Session 4. CONCLUSION: At-home KAT response and 
      remission rates indicated rapid and significant antidepressant and anxiolytic 
      effects. Rates were consistent with laboratory- and clinic-administered ketamine 
      treatment. Patient screening and remote monitoring maintained low levels of 
      adverse events. Future research should assess durability of effects.

TI  - Ketamine as a Novel Psychopharmacotherapy for Eating Disorders: Evidence and 
      Future Directions.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12030382 [doi]
LID - 382
AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) are serious, life-threatening psychiatric conditions 
      associated with physical and psychosocial impairment, as well as high morbidity 
      and mortality. Given the chronic refractory nature of EDs and the paucity of 
      evidence-based treatments, there is a pressing need to identify novel approaches 
      for this population. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) 
      antagonist, ketamine, has recently been approved for treatment-resistant 
      depression, exerting rapid and robust antidepressant effects. It is now being 
      investigated for several new indications, including obsessive-compulsive, 
      post-traumatic, and substance use disorder, and shows transdiagnostic potential 
      for EDs, particularly among clinical nonresponders. Hence, the aim of this review 
      is to examine contemporary findings on the treatment of EDs with ketamine, 
      whether used as a primary, adjunctive, or combination psychopharmacotherapy. 
      Avenues for future research are also discussed. Overall, results are encouraging 
      and point to therapeutic value; however, are limited to case series and reports 
      on anorexia nervosa. Further empirical research is thus needed to explore 
      ketamine efficacy across ED subgroups, establish safety profiles and optimize 
      dosing, and develop theory-driven, targeted treatment strategies at the 
      individual patient level.

LID - 917199
AB  - The mystical experience is a potential psychological mechanism to influence 
      outcome in psychedelic therapy. It includes features such as oceanic 
      boundlessness, ego dissolution, and universal interconnectedness, which have been 
      closely linked to both symptom reduction and improved quality of life. In this 
      review, 12 studies of psychedelic therapy utilizing psilocybin, ayahuasca, or 
      ketamine were analyzed for association between mystical experience and symptom 
      reduction, in areas as diverse as cancer-related distress, substance use 
      disorder, and depressive disorders to include treatment-resistant. Ten of the 
      twelve established a significant association of correlation, mediation, and/or 
      prediction. A majority of the studies are limited, however, by their small sample 
      size and lack of diversity (gender, ethnic, racial, educational, and 
      socioeconomic), common in this newly re-emerging field. Further, 6 out of 12 
      studies were open-label in design and therefore susceptible to bias. Future 
      studies of this nature should consider a larger sample size with greater 
      diversity and thus representation by use of randomized design. More in-depth 
      exploration into the nature of mystical experience is needed, including 
      predictors of intensity, in order to maximize its positive effects on treatment 
      outcome benefits and minimize concomitant anxiety. Systematic Review

TI  - The Efficacy of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy in Managing Post-traumatic Stress 
      Disorder (PTSD): A New Frontier?
PG  - e30919
LID - 10.7759/cureus.30919 [doi]
LID - e30919
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant public health concern for 
      which existing therapies are only marginally effective. Indisputably, the primary 
      line of treatment for PTSD is psychotherapy, according to current treatment 
      guidelines. However, PTSD continues to be a chronic condition even after 
      psychotherapy, with high psychiatric and medical illness rates. There is a dire 
      need to search for new compounds and approaches for managing PTSD. The usage of 
      psychedelic substances is a potential new method. This article reviews the 
      efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy in treating PTSD and improving patient 
      outcomes. It will examine current research on the topic and evaluate the benefits 
      and drawbacks of different therapies. The current evidence for the use of four 
      different types of psychedelics (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ketamine, 
      classical psychedelics, and cannabis) in the treatment of PTSD will be reviewed. 
      It will also include an overview of the therapeutic justification, context of 
      use, and level of evidence available for each drug. Several questions are 
      formulated that could be studied in future research in order to gain a better 
      understanding of the topic.

TI  - The Pharmacology and Clinical Applications of Psychedelic Medicines Within 
      Midwifery Practice.

AB  - The research and use of psychedelic medicines to treat common mental health 
      disorders has increased substantially in the past 2 decades. At the same time, 
      knowledge is relatively uncommon among midwives regarding (1) the relative 
      benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, (2) best practices associated with the 
      delivery of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and (3) responsible integration of this 
      potentially useful intervention into mental health treatment plans. The purpose 
      of this review is to describe current applications of psychedelic medicines to 
      treat common mental health disorders, to describe the current legal status of 
      these medicines used in this context, and to explore the potential for midwifery 
      practice in this area with further training. This article also addresses the 
      disparities regarding LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC populations in relation to this topic 
      and their historical exclusion from research and treatment access in this field.

AB  - Suicide is a pressing public health issue, with over 700,000 individuals dying 
      each year. Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for suicidal thoughts 
      and behaviors (STBs), yet the complex mechanisms underlying ketamine's 
      anti-suicidal effect are not fully understood. Computational psychiatry provides 
      a promising framework for exploring the dynamic interactions underlying 
      suicidality and ketamine's therapeutic action, offering insight into potential 
      biomarkers, treatment targets, and the underlying mechanisms of both. This paper 
      provides an overview of current computational theories of suicidality and 
      ketamine's mechanism of action, and discusses various computational modeling 
      approaches that attempt to explain ketamine's anti-suicidal effect. More 
      specifically, the therapeutic potential of ketamine is explored in the context of 
      the mismatch negativity and the predictive coding framework, by considering 
      neurocircuits involved in learning and decision-making, and investigating altered 
      connectivity strengths and receptor densities targeted by ketamine. Theory-driven 
      computational models offer a promising approach to integrate existing knowledge 
      of suicidality and ketamine, and for the extraction of model-derived mechanistic 
      parameters that can be used to identify patient subgroups and personalized 
      treatment approaches. Future computational studies on ketamine's mechanism of 
      action should optimize task design and modeling approaches to ensure parameter 
      reliability, and external factors such as set and setting, as well as 
      psychedelic-assisted therapy should be evaluated for their additional therapeutic 
      value.

TI  - Therapeutic role of psilocybin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in trauma: A 
      literature review.
PG  - 182-190
LID - 10.5498/wjp.v13.i5.182 [doi]
AB  - With the Food and Drug Administration designation in 2017 of 
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a breakthrough therapy in 
      post-traumatic stress disorder and psilocybin in treatment-resistant depression, 
      psychedelic drugs have continued to garner the attention of researchers and 
      clinicians for their promise of unmatched, rapid improvement in a multitude of 
      psychiatric conditions. Classic psychedelic drugs including psilocybin, lysergic 
      acid diethylamide, and ayahuasca, as well as non-classic drugs such as MDMA and 
      ketamine, are currently being investigated for a potential therapeutic role in 
      trauma, depressive disorders, and other psychopathologies. However, psilocybin 
      and MDMA each have a functional profile well-suited for integration with 
      psychotherapy. The present review focuses on psilocybin and MDMA in 
      psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), as these studies compose most of the 
      literature pool. In this review, we discuss the current and future uses of 
      psychedelic drugs, with an emphasis on the role of MDMA and psilocybin in PAT in 
      the setting of trauma and related comorbidities on the efficacy of psychedelic 
      drugs across multiple psychiatric disorders. The article concludes with thoughts 
      for future research, such as incorporating wearables and standardization of 
      symptom scales, therapy styles, and assessment of adverse drug reactions.

AB  - Eating disorders are serious illnesses showing high rates of mortality and 
      comorbidity with other mental health problems. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has 
      recently shown potential in the treatment of several common comorbidities of 
      eating disorders, including mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and 
      substance use disorders. The theorized therapeutic mechanisms of 
      psychedelic-assisted therapy suggest that it could be beneficial in the treatment 
      of eating disorders as well. In this review, we summarize preliminary data on the 
      efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy in people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia 
      nervosa, and binge eating disorder, which include studies and case reports of 
      psychedelic-assisted therapy with ketamine, MDMA, psilocybin, and ayahuasca. We 
      then discuss the potential therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelic-assisted therapy 
      in these three eating disorders, including both general therapeutic mechanisms 
      and those which are relatively specific to eating disorders. We find preliminary 
      evidence that psychedelic-assisted therapy may be effective in the treatment of 
      anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, with very little data available on binge 
      eating disorder. Regarding mechanisms, psychedelic-assisted therapy may be able 
      to improve beliefs about body image, normalize reward processing, promote 
      cognitive flexibility, and facilitate trauma processing. Just as importantly, it 
      appears to promote general therapeutic factors relevant to both eating disorders 
      and many of their common comorbidities. Lastly, we discuss potential safety 
      concerns which may be associated with these treatments and present 
      recommendations for future research.
