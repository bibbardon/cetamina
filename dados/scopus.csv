Psychedelic-assisted therapy has recently shown potential in the treatment of several common comorbidities of eating disorders, including mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. The theorized therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelic-assisted therapy suggest that it could be beneficial in the treatment of eating disorders as well. In this review, we summarize preliminary data on the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy in people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder, which include studies and case reports of psychedelic-assisted therapy with ketamine, MDMA, psilocybin, and ayahuasca. We then discuss the potential therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelic-assisted therapy in these three eating disorders, including both general therapeutic mechanisms and those which are relatively specific to eating disorders. We find preliminary evidence that psychedelic-assisted therapy may be effective in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, with very little data available on binge eating disorder. Regarding mechanisms, psychedelic-assisted therapy may be able to improve beliefs about body image, normalize reward processing, promote cognitive flexibility, and facilitate trauma processing. Just as importantly, it appears to promote general therapeutic factors relevant to both eating disorders and many of their common comorbidities. Lastly, we discuss potential safety concerns which may be associated with these treatments and present recommendations for future research. © 2023 The Author(s)","Anorexia nervosa; Bulimia nervosa; Eating disorders; MDMA; Psilocybin; Psychedelic-assisted therapy","ayahuasca; ketamine; midomafetamine; psilocybine; psychedelic agent; unclassified drug; anorexia nervosa; binge eating disorder; body image; bulimia; cognitive flexibility; comorbidity; drug efficacy; drug safety; eating disorder; feeding behavior; human; patient safety; psychedelic therapy; psychotrauma; Review; reward","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; midomafetamine, 42542-10-9; psilocybine, 520-52-5","","","Université de Fribourg","The study for supported by the University of Fribourg .

A key question is whether the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment improves outcomes or delays relapse. Aim To identify all studies combining psychotherapy with ketamine for the treatment of psychiatric disorders to summarise their effects and make recommendations for future research. Method The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022318120). Potential studies were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, the Cochrane library and Google Scholar. Eligible studies combined ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and did not use case reports or qualitative designs. Key findings relating to psychotherapy type, diagnosis, ketamine protocol, sequencing of psychotherapy and study design are reported. Risk of bias was assessed using modified Joanna Briggs critical appraisal tools. Results Nineteen studies evaluating 1006 patients were included in the systematic review. A variety of supportive individual and group, manualised and non-manualised psychotherapies were used. The majority of studies evaluated substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine protocols and sequencing of ketamine/psychotherapy treatment varied substantially between studies. Outcomes were largely positive for the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment. Conclusion The combination of psychotherapy and ketamine offers promise for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but study heterogeneity prevents definitive recommendations for their integration. Larger randomised controlled trials using manualised psychotherapies and standardised ketamine protocols are recommended to clarify the extent to which the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine improves outcomes over ketamine treatment alone.

We aimed to define priorities and envision an agenda for future research on psychedelic-assisted therapies in patients with serious illness. Over two days in January 2020, participants engaged in an iterative series of reflective exercises that elicited their attitude and perspectives on scientific opportunities for this research. Objectives: The aim of the study is to identify themes that shape priorities and an agenda for research on psychedelic-assisted therapy for those affected by serious illness. Methods: We collected data through preconference interviews, audio recordings, flip charts, and sticky notes. We applied thematic qualitative analysis to elucidate key themes. Results: We identified seven key opportunities to advance the field of psychedelic-assisted therapies in serious illness care. Four opportunities were related to the science and design of psychedelic-assisted therapies: clarifying indications; developing and refining therapeutic protocols; investigating the impact of set and setting on therapeutic outcomes; and understanding the mechanisms of action. The other three pertained to institutional and societal drivers to support optimal and responsible research: education and certification for therapists; regulations and funding; and diversity and inclusion. Additionally, participants suggested epistemological limitations of the medical model to understand the potential value and therapeutic use of psychedelics. Conclusions: Medicine and society are witnessing a resurgence of interest in the effects and applications of psychedelic-assisted therapies in a wide range of settings. This article suggests key opportunities for research in psychedelic-assisted therapies for those affected by serious illness.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","anxiety; depression; existential distress; palliative care; psychedelics; serious illness","Attitude; Hallucinogens; Humans; Palliative Care; Psycho-Oncology; ketamine; psilocybine; psychedelic agent; psychedelic agent; advanced cancer; Article; attitude to health; audio recording; cancer palliative therapy; certification; chronic disease; clinical research; exercise; funding; human; interview; medical education; near-death experience; oncology; psychedelic therapy; psycho-oncology; qualitative analysis; social psychology; spiritual care; translational research; treatment outcome; attitude; palliative therapy","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; psilocybine, 520-52-5; Hallucinogens, ","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie, (788945); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P30CA008748); Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, RIAS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Funding text 1: C.S.-P.’s contribution was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 788945.; Funding text 2: The project team is deeply grateful to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University for the financial support and close collaboration that made this project possible and to the seminar participants listed in Table 1 for bringing their expertise, passion, and collaborative spirit to this discussion.

This has mainly resulted from publicity associated with a number of high-profile investigations into psychedelic-assisted therapy for a range of difficult-to-treat mental health conditions. With many psychedelic substances known, including natural, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic, and a rangeof receptors, enzymes and transporters implicated in their modes of action, although very interesting, the field can appear daunting to newcomers to the area. This Primer Review is designed to give an overview of the chemistry and pharmacology of psychedelics. It is hoped that it will provide a useful resource for science undergraduates, postgraduates and their instructors, and experienced scientists who require a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the field. The Review begins with a summary of the important classes of psychedelics and then goes on to summarise the known history of their traditional human use, dating back to prehistoric times. Following that, important classes of psychedelics are examined in more detail, namely the ergolines, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), tryptamines like psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine, phenethylamines typified by mescaline and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), arylcyclohexylamines including ketamine and phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP), and a group of naturally occurring drugs that do not belong to any of these three classes, examples being muscimol and salvinorin A. The contributions made by early pioneers like Albert Hofmann and Alexander Shulgin are briefly summarised.

The current body of psychedelic research has focused on administration and treatment within a psychiatric context. Here, instead, we put to the test the contention that it is necessary to evaluate the current state of this literature from a broader biopsychosocial perspective. Examining these arguably neglected social and psychological aspects of psychedelic treatment can provide a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the interconnected domains. This review of six major clinical trials applies a biopsychosocial model to evaluate the antidepressant effects of psilocybin and ketamine assisted therapy. We conclude that combination psychedelic treatment and psychotherapy facilitate more enduring and profound antidepressant effects than produced by ketamine or psilocybin alone. Emphasising the advantages of therapeutic intervention will encourage those who may attempt to self-medicate with psychedelics to instead seek a framework of psychological support, minimising associated risks of unregulated use.  © 2022 The Author(s).","clinical; depression; psychedelics; review; therapy","","","","","","","","Al-Harbi H., Treatment-resistant depression: Therapeutic trends, challenges, and future directions, Patient Preference and Adherence, 6, (2012); Aleksandrova L., Phillips A., Wang Y., Antidepressant effects of ketamine and the roles of AMPA glutamate receptors and other mechanisms beyond NMDA receptor antagonism, Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, 42, 4, pp. 222-229, (2017); Baldwin D., Montgomery S., Nil R., Lader M., Discontinuation symptoms in depression and anxiety disorders, The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 10, 1, (2005); Ballard E., Ionescu D., Vande Voort J., Niciu M., Richards E., Luckenbaugh D., Et al., Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: Relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety, Journal of Psychiatric Research, 58, pp. 161-166, (2014); Belouin S., Henningfield J., Psychedelics: Where we are now, why we got here, what we must do, Neuropharmacology, 142, pp. 7-19, (2018); Berman R., Cappiello A., Anand A., Oren D., Heninger G., Charney D., Krystal J., Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients, Biological Psychiatry, 47, 4, pp. 351-354, (2000); Bonson K., Murphy D., Alterations in responses to LSD in humans associated with chronic administration of tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or lithium, Behavioural Brain Research, 73, 1-2, pp. 229-233, (1995); Bottemanne H., Morlaas O., Claret A., Fossati P., Schmidt L., Can we change depressive beliefs?

There is an urgent need for more effective treatments. Ketamine was recently established to alleviate pain and depression, but many gaps remain in the scientific literature. This paper reports the findings of an observational preliminary study that explored the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAPT) for chronic pain/major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbidity. Researchers evaluated two KAPT approaches to determine optimal route of administration/dose. Ten individuals diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder and MDD receiving KAPT were recruited: five individuals pursuing the psychedelic approach (high doses administered intramuscularly 24 h before therapy) and five individuals pursuing the psycholytic approach (low doses administered sublingually via oral lozenges during therapy). To evaluate differences between altered states of consciousness each approach induces, participants completed the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) after their first (T-1), third (T-2) and sixth/final (T-3) treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form scores from baseline (T0) to (T-1)–(T-3). Secondary outcomes were changes in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale scores and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) scores at each timepoint. Statistically significant differences between each approach were not observed, but the small sample’s limited statistical power makes changes seen worth noting. All participants’ symptoms declined throughout treatment. Psychedelic treatment participants saw a larger, more consistent decrease. Researchers conclude that KAPT may be effective for treating chronic pain/MDD comorbidity, anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Findings imply that the psychedelic approach may be more effective. This pilot study serves as a basis for more extensive research that will inform how clinicians administer treatment to optimize outcomes. 2023 Batievsky, Weiner, Kaplan, Thase, Maglione and Vidot.","depression; intramuscular; ketamine; microdose; pain; psychedelic; psycholytic; therapy","","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","This study was funded by University of Pennsylvania's Millstein Family Undergraduate Research Grant.

There is currently an adolescent mental health crisis, with a high prevalence of disorders, diagnostic complexity, and many adolescents failing to respond to conventional treatments. While there is strong evidence for the use of ketamine in adults for a variety of treatment-refractory mental illnesses, research in adolescents is in its early stages. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) has been described in adults with promising results and here we present the first published cases of the use of KAP in adolescents. The four cases include adolescents aged 14–19 at the initiation of treatment, each with a variety of comorbid diagnoses including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, panic, and trauma-related symptoms. They each initially received sublingual ketamine, followed by sessions with intramuscular ketamine. Their courses varied, but each had symptomatic and functional improvements, and the treatment was well-tolerated. Subjective patient reports are included. Rapid resolution of symptomatology and suffering often occurs within months as the result of the application of KAP to adolescent psychiatric care but is not inevitable. Family involvement in the treatment process appears to be essential to success. The development of this modality may have a singularly positive impact that will expand the psychiatric toolbox and its healing potency.

Its limited short-term durability has motivated research into the potential synergistic actions between ketamine and psychotherapy to sustain benefits. This systematic review on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) sum-marizes existing evidence regarding present-day practices. Through rigorous review, seventeen articles that included 603 participants were identified. From available KAP publications, it is apparent that combined treatments can, in specific circumstances, initiate and prolong clinically significant reductions in pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, while encouraging rapport and treatment engagement, and promoting abstinence in patients addicted to other substances. Despite much variance in how KAP is applied (route of ketamine administration, ketamine dosage/frequency, psychotherapy modality, overall treatment length), these findings suggest psychotherapy, provided before, during, and following ketamine sessions, can maximize and prolong benefits. Additional large-scale randomized control trials are warranted to understand better the mutually influential relationships between psychotherapy and ketamine in optimizing responsiveness and sustaining long-term benefits in patients with chronic pain. Such investigations will assist in developing standardized practices and maintenance programs. © 2022 Drozdz et al.","addiction; alternative treatment; anesthesia; chronic pain; mental health; novel therapeutic","cocaine;

Much of this research has evolved within the framework of several independent branches of scientific inquiry: in addition to the study of ketamine is a non-selective NMDAR antagonist with rapid antidepressant effects, it has also been found effective as a psychoplastogen that stimulates synaptogenesis and increases neuroplasticity, as a powerful anti-inflammatory that may improve inflammation-related depressive symptoms, as a substance that induces beneficial high entropy brain states, and as a subjectively impactful psychedelic agent. Each branch of inquiry has generated independent evidence of ketamine's efficacy but has advanced without substantive coordination or communication with other lines of inquiry. Integrative research that considers these branches of research together may lead toward a better understanding of ketamine's effects and improved treatment protocols and clinical outcomes. Such an overview can inform more comprehensive patient care through: (a) informed patient psychoeducation that encompasses all of ketamine's mechanisms of action; (b) calibration of optimal dosage to ensure induction and maintenance of high entropy brain states during each ketamine session utilizing EEG measurement; (c) Improved management of emergence side effects through proper care for set and setting; (d) inclusion of pre-selected appropriate music to enhance the emotional experience; (e) increased monitoring of ketamine effects on cortical activity, inter-hemispheric imbalance, and inflammation-related levels of cytokines to further improvements in ketamine protocols; and (f) appropriate timing of any adjunctive psychotherapy sessions to coincide with peak neurogenesis at 24–48 h post ketamine treatment.

Recently, ketamine has attracted attention as a rapid-acting anti-depressant but other studies have also reported its efficacy in reducing problematic alcohol and drug use. This review explores the preclinical and clinical research into ketamine's ability to treat addiction. Despite methodological limitations and the relative infancy of the field, results thus far are promising. Ketamine has been shown to effectively prolong abstinence from alcohol and heroin in detoxified alcoholics and heroin dependent individuals, respectively. Moreover, ketamine reduced craving for and self-administration of cocaine in non-treatment seeking cocaine users. However, further randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm ketamine's efficacy. Possible mechanisms by which ketamine may work within addiction include: enhancement of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, disruption of relevant functional neural networks, treating depressive symptoms, blocking reconsolidation of drug-related memories, provoking mystical experiences and enhancing psychological therapy efficacy. Identifying the mechanisms by which ketamine exerts its therapeutic effects in addiction, from the many possible candidates, is crucial for advancing this treatment and may have broader implications understanding other psychedelic therapies. In conclusion, ketamine shows great promise as a treatment for various addictions, but well-controlled research is urgently needed.

In this review we will chart the research investigating the role of these interventions in individuals with addiction beginning with an overview of the current socioeconomic impact of addiction, treatment options, and outcomes. We will start by examining historical studies from the first psychedelic research era of the mid-late 1900s, followed by an overview of the available real-world evidence gathered from naturalistic, observational, and survey-based studies. We will then cover modern-day clinical trials of psychedelic therapies in addiction from first-in-human to phase II clinical trials. Finally, we will provide an overview of the different translational human neuropsychopharmacology techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), that can be applied to foster a mechanistic understanding of therapeutic mechanisms. A more granular understanding of the treatment effects of psychedelics will facilitate the optimisation of the psychedelic therapy drug development landscape, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Psychedelic-assisted therapies show significant promise in the treatment of a number of clinically challenging conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life distress. Ketamine is currently the only safe, effective and legal widely available psychedelic-like medicine. To address the echo pandemic of health care provider distress, a multi-disciplinary team was charged with developing a ketamine-assisted psychotherapy program, delivered in a community of practice (CoP) group model and evaluated in a quality improvement framework. Program evaluation occurred through mixed methods. Quantitative mental health assessments included the PHQ-9 for depression, the PCL-5 for PTSD, GAD-7 for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and B-IPF for work/life functionality. Participant narrative feedback was collected to evaluate outcomes and for quality improvement purposes. Mean mental health scores were collected across three cohorts, totaling 94 patients. The mean aggregate scores of participants meeting the mental health assessment cut-off criteria (screening positive) were analyzed to assess clinical significance. Mean aggregate results comparing baseline vs. outcome measures (measured within 1–2 weeks after completion of the 12-week program) were clinically significant, demonstrating significant improvements in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and work/life functionality. In summary, 91% saw improvements in generalized anxiety, 79% saw improvements in depression, 86% of those who screened positive for PTSD now screen negative, and 92% had significant life/work functionality improvements. Qualitative feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with several unsolicited self-reports of transformation. Participant and team feedback enables the program to continue improving with each iteration. Results speak to the effectiveness of ketamine for psychedelic-assisted therapy, supported by a CoP framework. Outcomes are relevant for mental health programming, education and healthcare policy.

Case presentation: This study reports on five participants with a diagnosis of an ED and comorbid mood and anxiety disorders who received weekly intramuscular ketamine injections in a group setting over 4 weeks. Measures of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) were administered pre-dose, 4-h post-dose, and 24-h post dose. Four of the 5 participants experienced clinically significant improvements on the PHQ-9 score (i.e., change greater than 5) while 2 of the 5 participants experienced clinically significant improvements on the GAD-7 score (i.e., change greater than 4) from pre-dose to 24-h post-dose after the last ketamine session. Dosing sessions were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. Clinical observations and participant reports corroborated improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, good tolerability of ketamine treatment, and practical implementation of the G-KAP protocol in a residential ED treatment center. Conclusions: This study suggests the potential utility of G-KAP as an adjunct to intensive, specialized ED treatment. Overall, this novel, cross-diagnostic intervention warrants future research to further explore its appropriateness in a treatment setting. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anxiety; Case series; Depression; Feeding and eating disorders;

The classic serotonergic psychedelics psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide and nonclassic psychedelics 3,4-methylenediox-ymethamphetamine and ketamine are increasingly appreciated as neuroplastogens given their potential to fundamentally alter mood and behavior well beyond the time window of measurable exposure. Imaging studies with psychedelics are also helping advance our understanding of neural networks and connectomics. This resurgence in psychedelic science and psychedelic-assisted therapy has potential significance for the fields of neurosurgery and neuro-oncology and their diverse and challenging patients, many of whom continue to have mental health issues and poor quality of life despite receiving state-of-the-art care. In this study, we review recent and ongoing clinical trials, the set and setting model of psychedelic-assisted therapy, potential risks and adverse events, proposed mechanisms of action, and provide a perspective on how the safe and evidence-based use of psychedelics could potentially benefit many patients, including those with brain tumors, pain syndromes, ruminative disorders, stroke, SAH, TBI, and movement disorders. By leveraging psychedelics’ neuroplastic potential to rehabilitate the mind and brain, novel treatments may be possible for many of these patient populations, in some instances working synergistically with current treatments and in some using subpsychedelic doses that do not require mind-altering effects for efficacy. This review aims to encourage broader multidisciplinary collaboration across the neurosciences to explore and help realize the transdiagnostic healing potential of psychedelics.

Physicians also experience high rates of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and burnout. These conditions frequently develop during medical school, and threaten not only physicians but the patients they care for. A 30-year-old medical student presented to our clinic with a history of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), PTSD, and 5 years of daily suicidal ideation. Previous treatments included therapy, lifestyle modifications, and various combinations of six antidepressants. These interventions had little effect on the patient’s mental health. The patient was treated at our clinic with an 8-month regimen of IV ketamine infusions and ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP). The patient achieved remission from suicidality and PTSD within 1 month; and TRD and GAD within 7 months. The patient’s Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score decreased from 25 (severe depression) to 1 (not depressed). These findings suggest that ketamine and KAP may represent effective interventions for mental health applications in healthcare professionals. The patient made the unique decision to attempt to type narrative journals during four of his ketamine infusions (doses ranged from 1.8 to 2.1 mg/kg/h IV). The patient successfully typed detailed journals throughout each 1-h ketamine infusion. To our knowledge, these journals represent the first independently typed, first-person, real-time narratives of ketamine-induced non ordinary states of consciousness. The transcripts of these journals may provide useful insights for clinicians, particularly in the context of KAP.

Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.

This retrospective clinical chart review is the first of its kind to assess the utility of sublingual ketamine-assisted body-centered psychotherapy in trauma-exposed patients in a real world clinic setting. De-identified clinical records data on self-reported symptom measures were retrospectively analyzed for patients (N = 18; M age = 45.22, SD = 12.90) entering ketamine-assisted psychotherapy treatment in an outpatient clinic between 2018 and 2020. Patients who completed six sessions of ketamine therapy reported meaningful (e.g., medium effect size) improvements in PTSD symptoms (P = 0.058; d = -0.48) and global disability in functioning (P = 0.050; d = -0.52) and statistically significant and meaningful improvements in depression (P = 0.019; d = -0.53). There were no improvements in anxiety symptoms. Sublingual ketamine-assisted psychotherapy was associated with heterogenous clinical utility among patients with trauma-exposure in an outpatient setting. This study was underpowered and unrepresentative of the population of ketamine patients in the United States. Replication of these findings is needed with larger and more diverse patient samples. © 2021 The Author(s).","depression; ketamine; mindfulness; psychotherapy; PTSD; trauma","","","","","","","","Allem J.P., Soto D.W., Baezconde-Garbanati L., Et al., Adverse childhood experiences and substance use among Hispanic emerging adults in Southern California, Addictive Behaviors, 50, pp. 199-204, (2015); Bader K., Schafer V., Schenkel M., Et al., Adverse childhood experiences associated with sleep in primary insomnia, Journal of Sleep Research, 16, 3, pp. 285-296, (2007); Bisson J.I., Ehlers A., Matthews R., Et al., Psychological treatments for chronic post-Traumatic stress disorder.

Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), yet the complex mechanisms underlying ketamine’s anti-suicidal effect are not fully understood. Computational psychiatry provides a promising framework for exploring the dynamic interactions underlying suicidality and ketamine’s therapeutic action, offering insight into potential biomarkers, treatment targets, and the underlying mechanisms of both. This paper provides an overview of current computational theories of suicidality and ketamine’s mechanism of action, and discusses various computational modeling approaches that attempt to explain ketamine’s anti-suicidal effect. More specifically, the therapeutic potential of ketamine is explored in the context of the mismatch negativity and the predictive coding framework, by considering neurocircuits involved in learning and decision-making, and investigating altered connectivity strengths and receptor densities targeted by ketamine. Theory-driven computational models offer a promising approach to integrate existing knowledge of suicidality and ketamine, and for the extraction of model-derived mechanistic parameters that can be used to identify patient subgroups and personalized treatment approaches. Future computational studies on ketamine’s mechanism of action should optimize task design and modeling approaches to ensure parameter reliability, and external factors such as set and setting, as well as psychedelic-assisted therapy should be evaluated for their additional therapeutic value.

Previous systematic reviews assessing the efficacy of psilocybin in SUDs only included clinical trials conducted in the last 25 years, but they may have missed clinical trials assessing the efficacy of psilocybin that were conducted before the 1980s, given much research has been done with psychedelics in the mid-20th century. In this systematic review, we specifically assessed the efficacy of psilocybin in patients with a SUD or non-substance-related disorder with no publication date restrictions in our search strategy. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines from the earliest published manuscript up to September 2, 2022, in seven electronic databases, including clinical trials in patients with a SUD or non-substance-related disorder evaluating the efficacy of psilocybin. Results: A total of four studies (six articles, of which two articles were long-term follow-up results from the same trial) were included in this systematic review. Psilocybin-assisted therapy was administered to n = 151 patients in a dose ranging from 6 to 40 mg. Three studies focused on alcohol use disorder, and one study on tobacco use disorder. In a pilot study (n = 10), the percentage of heavy drinking days decreased significantly between baseline and weeks 5–12 (mean difference of 26.0, 95% CI = 8.7–43.2, p = 0.008). In another single-arm study (n = 31), 32% (10/31) became completely abstinent from alcohol (mean duration of follow-up 6 years). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT, n = 95), the percentage of heavy drinking days during the 32-week double-blind period was significantly lower for psilocybin compared to placebo (mean difference of 13.9, 95% CI = 3.0–24.7, p = 0.01). In a pilot study (n = 15), the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks was 80% (12/15), and at 52 weeks 67% (10/15). Conclusion: Only one RCT and three small clinical trials were identified assessing the efficacy of psilocybin combined with some form of psychotherapy in patients with alcohol and tobacco use disorder. All four clinical trials indicated a beneficial effect of psilocybin-assisted therapy on SUD symptoms. Larger RCTs in patients with SUDs need to evaluate whether psilocybin-assisted therapy is effective in patients with SUD.

This treatment provokes dissociative effects associating derealization and depersonalization, and a synaptogenic signaling cascade promoting brain plasticity. Despite several preliminary studies suggesting the usefulness of its combination with psychotherapy, administration of ketamine isn't generally combined with per- and post-infusion psychotherapy protocols in its clinical antidepressant use. However, the phenomenology of psychodysleptic experiences and the synaptogenic effect could potentiate cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBT). In this article, we purpose a practical protocol to Ketamine Augmented Psychotherapy (KAP) synthesizing contemporary data from the literature and our clinical experience. We detail proposals for clinical practice, and propose four important steps for the use of a psychodysleptic molecule for antidepressant purposes: preparation, administration, integration, and prolongation. Finally, we discuss the limits and prospects of this combination in the management of mood disorders. © 2021 L'Encéphale, Paris","Antidepressant; Augmented psychotherapy; Belief; Belief updating; Dissociation; Ketamine; Ketamine assisted psychotherapy; Predictive coding; Psychedelic","Antidepressive Agents; Dissociative Disorders; Humans; Ketamine; Mood Disorders; Psychotherapy; ketamine; antidepressant agent; Article; clinical pathway; human; mental disease; mood disorder; psychopharmacotherapy; psychotherapy; dissociative disorder; mood disorder; procedures; psychotherapy","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; Antidepressive Agents, ; Ketamine, ","","","","","Aan Het Rot M., Zarate C.A., Charney D.S., Et al., Ketamine for depression: where do we go from here?, Biol Psychiatry, 72, 7, pp. 537-547, (2012); Sofia R.D., Harakal J.J., Evaluation of ketamine HCl for antidepressant activity, Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther, 214, 1, pp. 68-74, (1975); Berman R.M., Cappiello A., Anand A., Et al., Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients, Biol Psychiatry, 47, 4, pp. 351-354, (2000); Romeo B., Choucha W., Fossati P., Et al., Meta-analysis of short- and mid-term efficacy of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression, Psychiatry Res, 230, 2, pp. 682-688, (2015); Kryst J., Kawalec P., Mitoraj A.M., Et al., Efficacy of single and repeated administration of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, Pharmacol Rep, 72, 3, pp. 543-562, (2020); Conley A.A., Norwood A.E.Q., Hatvany T.C., Et al., Efficacy of ketamine for major depressive episodes at 2, 4, and 6-weeks post-treatment: a meta-analysis, Psychopharmacology (Berl), 238, pp. 1737-1752, (2021); Fava M., Freeman M.P., Flynn M., Et al., Double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of intravenous ketamine as adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), Mol Psychiatry, 25, 7, pp. 1592-1603, (2020); Chen M.-H., Chang W.-C., Lin W.-C., Et al., Functional dysconnectivity of frontal cortex to striatum predicts ketamine infusion response in treatment-resistant depression, Int J Neuropsychopharmacol, 23, pp. 791-798, (2020); Han Y., Chen J., Zou D., Et al., Efficacy of ketamine in the rapid treatment of major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, 12, pp. 2859-2867, (2016); Bottemanne H., Claret A., Fossati P., Kétamine et autres psychotropes, Prescrire les psychotropes, (2020); Vande Voort J.L., Morgan R.J., Kung S., Et al., Continuation phase intravenous ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression, J Affect Disord, 206, pp. 300-304, (2016); Bottemanne H., Claret A., Fossati P., [Ketamine, psilocybin, and rapid acting antidepressant: new promise for psychiatry?], Encéphale, 47, pp. 171-178, (2020); Sar V., The many faces of dissociation: opportunities for innovative research in psychiatry, Clin Psychopharmacol Neurosci, 12, 3, pp. 171-179, (2014); Braithwaite J.J., James K., Dewe H., Et al., Fractionating the unitary notion of dissociation: disembodied but not embodied dissociative experiences are associated with exocentric perspective-taking, Front Hum Neurosci, 7, (2013); Niciu M.J., Shovestul B.J., Jaso B.A., Et al., Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression, J Affect Disord, 232, pp. 310-315, (2018); Sumner R.L., Chacko E., McMillan R., Et al., A qualitative and quantitative account of patient's experiences of ketamine and its antidepressant properties, J Psychopharmacol, 35, pp. 946-961, (2021); Adler C.M., Malhotra A.K., Elman I., Et al., Comparison of ketamine-induced thought disorder in healthy volunteers and thought disorder in schizophrenia, Am J Psychiatry, 156, 10, pp. 1646-1649, (1999); Hasler G., Suker S., Schoretsanitis G., Et al., Sustained improvement of negative self-schema after a single ketamine infusion: an open-label study, Front Neurosci, 14, (2020); Corlett P.R., Frith C.D., Fletcher P.C., From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis, Psychopharmacology (Berl), 206, 4, pp. 515-530, (2009); Corlett P.R., Honey G.D., Fletcher P.C., Prediction error, ketamine and psychosis: an updated model, J Psychopharmacol, 30, 11, pp. 1145-1155, (2016); Corlett P.R., Cambridge V., Gardner J.M., Et al., Ketamine effects on memory reconsolidation favor a learning model of delusions, PLoS One, 8, 6, (2013); Bottemanne H., Morlaas O., Claret A., Et al., Can we change depressive beliefs?

Over the past several years, ketamine has come into psychiatric use as an intervention for treatment resistant depression (TRD), administered intravenously without a psychotherapeutic component. In these settings, ketamine’s psychedelic effects are viewed as undesirable “side effects.” In contrast, we believe ketamine can benefit patients with a wide variety of diagnoses when administered with psychotherapy and using its psychedelic properties without need for intravenous (IV) access. Its proven safety over decades of use makes it ideal for office and supervised at-home use. The unique experience that ketamine facilitates with its biological, experiential, and psychological impacts has been tailored to optimize office-based treatment evolving into a method that we call Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP). This article is the first to explore KAP within an analytical framework examining three distinct practices that use similar methods. Here, we present demographic and outcome data from 235 patients. Our findings suggest that KAP is an effective method for decreasing depression and anxiety in a private practice setting, especially for older patients and those with severe symptom burden. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, research to date focuses almost exclusively on adults. I argue that adolescents should be included in research into psychedelic therapies. First, I demonstrate the pressing need for novel interventions to address the growing mental health burden of adolescents, and I draw on empirical evidence to show that research into psychedelic therapies presents an opportunity to address this shortfall. Secondly, I argue that psychedelics pose low risk to young patients, particularly relative to existing psychiatric medications. I then address two major concerns specific to adolescent contexts. First, I address the risks of using psychedelic substances at earlier stages of physiological and cognitive development. I note that the lack of understanding of the risks underscores the need for including adolescents in research. I then address the added complexity of consent in the adolescent context. I highlight some additional concerns that should be addressed in an “enhanced” informed consent process for adolescents and defend the view that capable adolescents should be able to consent to psychedelic interventions. I ultimately hold that including adolescents in emerging psychedelic research has the potential to substantiate innovative treatments that could improve their clinical outcomes, long-term mental health and quality of life. © Khaleel Rajwani, 2022.","adolescent mental health;

Preliminary clinical studies of the hallucinogenic fungi, psilocybin, with psychological support, have indicated improvements in mood, anxiety and quality of life. A seminal, open-label study demonstrated marked reductions in depression symptoms in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The associated neurobiological processes involve alterations in brain connectivity, together with altered amygdala and default mode network activity. At the cellular level, psychedelics promote synaptogenesis and neural plasticity. Prompted by the promising preliminary studies, a randomized, double-blind trial has recently been launched across Europe and North America to investigate the efficacy of psilocybin in TRD. One of these centres is based in Ireland – CHO Area 7 and Tallaght University Hospital. The outcome of this trial will determine whether psilocybin with psychological support will successfully translate into the psychiatric clinic for the benefit of patients. © College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2019.","Depression;

It includes features such as oceanic boundlessness, ego dissolution, and universal interconnectedness, which have been closely linked to both symptom reduction and improved quality of life. In this review, 12 studies of psychedelic therapy utilizing psilocybin, ayahuasca, or ketamine were analyzed for association between mystical experience and symptom reduction, in areas as diverse as cancer-related distress, substance use disorder, and depressive disorders to include treatment-resistant. Ten of the twelve established a significant association of correlation, mediation, and/or prediction. A majority of the studies are limited, however, by their small sample size and lack of diversity (gender, ethnic, racial, educational, and socioeconomic), common in this newly re-emerging field. Further, 6 out of 12 studies were open-label in design and therefore susceptible to bias. Future studies of this nature should consider a larger sample size with greater diversity and thus representation by use of randomized design. More in-depth exploration into the nature of mystical experience is needed, including predictors of intensity, in order to maximize its positive effects on treatment outcome benefits and minimize concomitant anxiety.

The renewed interest in the potential application of psychedelic compounds as novel therapeutics has led to promising preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in some psychiatric disorders. Despite these promising results, the potential for large-scale clinical application of these profoundly consciousness-altering substances, in isolation from the sociocultural contexts in which they were traditionally used, raises important concerns. These concerns stem from the recognition that the mechanisms of therapeutic action of psychedelics are not entirely dependent on neurobiology, but also on the psychological, social and spiritual processes for their efficacy. For these reasons, physicians or psychotherapists involved in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy need training in ways to accompany patients through this experience to promote positive outcomes and address potential side effects. Psychedelic therapies may foster the emergence of a novel paradigm in psychiatry that integrates psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and cultural interventions for patients with mental health issues. © The Author(s) 2022.","consciousness; context; culture; ketamine; LSD; psilocybin; Psychedelics; psychotherapy","Hallucinogens; Humans; Mental Disorders; Psychiatry; Recognition, Psychology; escitalopram; illicit drug; ketamine; melatonin; psilocybine; psychedelic agent; psychedelic agent; anxiety; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical outcome; cognition; consciousness; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; headache; human; immunomodulation; meditation; mental health; neurobiology; organization; outcome assessment; psychedelic therapy; psychosis; psychotherapy; public health; schizophrenia; social psychology; training; mental disease; psychiatry","","escitalopram, 128196-01-0, 219861-08-2; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; melatonin, 73-31-4; psilocybine, 520-52-5; Hallucinogens, ","","","Diamond Therapeutics Inc.; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC; Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé, FRQS; Mitacs","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr Gobbi received grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, MITACS and Diamond Therapeutics Inc. for research on psychedelics.

To achieve this, we have distinguished between two types of plasticity, an early one that we call ‘TEMP’ for ‘Temperature or Entropy Mediated Plasticity’, and another, we call ‘canalization’, which is close to Hebbian plasticity. These two forms of plasticity can be most easily distinguished by their relationship to ‘precision’ or inverse variance; TEMP relates to increased model variance or decreased precision, whereas the opposite is true for canalization. TEMP also subsumes increased learning rate, (Ising) temperature and entropy. Dictionary definitions of ‘plasticity’ describe it as the property of being easily shaped or molded; TEMP is the better match for this. Importantly, we propose that ‘pathological’ phenotypes develop via mechanisms of canalization or increased model precision, as a defensive response to adversity and associated distress or dysphoria. Our model states that canalization entrenches in psychopathology, narrowing the phenotypic state-space as the agent develops expertise in their pathology. We suggest that TEMP – combined with gently guiding psychological support – can counter canalization. We address questions of whether and when canalization is adaptive versus maladaptive, furnish our model with references to basic and human neuroscience, and offer concrete experiments and measures to test its main hypotheses and implications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","Depressive Disorder, Major; Humans; Learning; Phenotype; United States; ketamine; midomafetamine; psilocin; psilocybine; psychedelic agent; serotonin 2A agonist; addiction; anorexia; anxiety disorder; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; bipolar disorder; canalization; cocaine dependence; cognitive therapy; compulsion; craving; depression; distress syndrome; drug effect; dysphoria; eating disorder; electroconvulsive therapy; entropy; environmental enrichment; genetic parameters; Hebbian plasticity; human; learning; mental disease; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; nonhuman; obsessive compulsive disorder; personality disorder; phenotype; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychedelic therapy; psychosis; psychotherapy; Review; schizophrenia; synaptogenesis; temperature; temperature or entropy mediated plasticity; theoretical study; treatment resistant depression; learning; major depression; United States","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; midomafetamine, 42542-10-9; psilocin, 26159-83-1, 520-53-6; psilocybine, 520-52-5","","","","","Abraham W.C., Metaplasticity: tuning synapses and networks for plasticity, Nat.

At the same time, knowledge is relatively uncommon among midwives regarding (1) the relative benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, (2) best practices associated with the delivery of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and (3) responsible integration of this potentially useful intervention into mental health treatment plans. The purpose of this review is to describe current applications of psychedelic medicines to treat common mental health disorders, to describe the current legal status of these medicines used in this context, and to explore the potential for midwifery practice in this area with further training. This article also addresses the disparities regarding LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC populations in relation to this topic and their historical exclusion from research and treatment access in this field. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: In this prospective study, a large outpatient sample received KAT over four weeks through a telehealth provider. Symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics, adverse events, and patient-reported dissociation were also analyzed. Symptom trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modeling, along with outcome predictors. Results: A sample of 1247 completed treatment with sufficient data, 62.8 % reported a 50 % or greater improvement on the PHQ-9, d = 1.61, and 62.9 % on the GAD-7, d = 1.56. Remission rates were 32.6 % for PHQ-9 and 31.3 % for GAD-7, with 0.9 % deteriorating on the PHQ-9, and 0.6 % on the GAD-7. Four patients left treatment early due to side effects or clinician disqualification, and two more due to adverse events. Three patient subpopulations emerged, characterized by Improvement (79.3 %), Chronic (11.4 %), and Delayed Improvement (9.3 %) for PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Endorsing side effects at Session 2 was associated with delayed symptom improvement, and Chronic patients were more likely than the other two groups to report dissociation at Session 4. Conclusion: At-home KAT response and remission rates indicated rapid and significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Rates were consistent with laboratory- and clinic-administered ketamine treatment. Patient screening and remote monitoring maintained low levels of adverse events. Future research should assess durability of effects. © 2022 The Authors","Anxiety; Digital health; Ketamine-assisted therapy; Major depression; Psychedelic-assisted therapy; Real-world; Telemedicine","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Humans; Ketamine; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Telemedicine; antidepressant agent; ketamine; ketamine; adult; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; anxiety; Article; chronic patient; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; clinical trial; Columbia suicide severity rating scale; drinking behavior; drug abuse; electrocardiogram; electronic health record; electronic medical record; female; follow up; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; home care; home environment; human; human tissue; informed consent; major depression; male; mental health service; outpatient care; patient health questionnaire; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; physical examination; physician assistant; prospective study; psychedelic therapy; psychosocial care; psychotherapy; remote sensing; risk assessment; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; telehealth; total quality management; treatment response; unsupervised machine learning; videoconferencing; anxiety; depression; pandemic; prospective study; psychology; telemedicine","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; Ketamine, ","","","TJA","None.

Many bipolar patients have refractory depressive episodes. Racemic ketamine, a glutamate modulator with prominent dissociate and psychedelic properties, has been demonstrated to have rapid acting antidepressant and anti-obsessional effects which may be useful for treating the symptoms of bipolar depression. Most of the existing research literature on unipolar and bipolar depression has looked at racemic ketamine in the sub-psychedelic dose range given by infusion as a stand-alone treatment (without concurrent psychotherapy). This article expands on the existing research by articulating three different paradigms for ketamine treatment: biochemical, psychotherapeutic, and psychedelic. The authors use composite clinical vignettes to illustrate different ways of working with ketamine to treat bipolar depression, and discuss a variety of clinical considerations for using ketamine with this population, including route, dose, frequency, chemical mitigators, and adverse events. Note that the conceptual paradigms could be applied to any ketamine treatment, with broad applicability beyond bipolar treatment.

Given the chronic refractory nature of EDs and the paucity of evidence-based treatments, there is a pressing need to identify novel approaches for this population. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist, ketamine, has recently been approved for treatment-resistant depression, exerting rapid and robust antidepressant effects. It is now being investigated for several new indications, including obsessive–compulsive, post-traumatic, and substance use disorder, and shows transdiagnostic potential for EDs, particularly among clinical nonresponders. Hence, the aim of this review is to examine contemporary findings on the treatment of EDs with ketamine, whether used as a primary, adjunctive, or combination psychopharmacotherapy. Avenues for future research are also discussed. Overall, results are encouraging and point to therapeutic value; however, are limited to case series and reports on anorexia nervosa. Further empirical research is thus needed to explore ketamine efficacy across ED subgroups, establish safety profiles and optimize dosing, and develop theory-driven, targeted treatment strategies at the individual patient level. © 2022 by the authors.

Of people who died by suicide, the majority are diagnosed with depression. It is estimated that 25%-60% of people with bipolar depression (BD) will attempt suicide at least once, and 10%-15% will die by suicide. Several treatments, such as lithium, clozapine, electroconvulsive therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective in treating suicidality. However, these treatments can be difficult to tolerate or may take months to take effect. Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antisuicidal effect and antidepressant qualities, and is thus a promising intervention to target acute suicidality in patients with BD. However, the biological mechanism underlying its therapeutic action remains poorly understood. Enhancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms of action for ketamine’s effectiveness in reducing suicidality is critical to establishing biological markers of treatment response and developing tailored, personalized interventions for patients with BD. Objective: This is an open-label clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions to treat acute suicidality. The primary objective is to test the safety and feasibility of ketamine intervention. The secondary objective is to examine ketamine’s potential neurophysiological mechanisms of action by assessing cortical excitation and inhibition to determine potential biomarkers of clinical response. Other objectives are to evaluate the effect of ketamine on acute suicidality and other clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and quality of life, to inform a future larger trial. Methods: This open-label clinical trial aims to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with BD for suicidality and to assess ketamine’s neurophysiological effects. A sterile form of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered over a 40-minute intravenous infusion 2 times per week on nonconsecutive days for 4 weeks (8 sessions). We will recruit 30 adults (24-65 year olds) over 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. Results: This study is currently ongoing and actively recruiting participants. So far, 5 participants have completed the trial, 1 is currently in active treatment, and 8 participants are on the waitlist to be screened. We anticipate initial results being available in the fall of 2023. This proposal was presented as a poster presentation at the Research to Reality Global Summit on Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies and Medicine, held in May 2022 in Toronto, Canada. Conclusions: Developing effective interventions for acute suicidality in high-risk populations such as those with BD remains a major therapeutic challenge. Ketamine is a promising treatment due to its rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, but its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of action remain unknown. © Yuliya Knyahnytska, Reza Zomorrodi, Tyler Kaster, Daphne Voineskos, Alisson Trevizol, Daniel Blumberger.","bipolar depression; ketamine intervention; neurophysiological markers of response; suicidality","","","","","","","","Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention, (2017); Pompili M, Gonda X, Serafini G, Innamorati M, Sher L, Amore M, Et al., Epidemiology of suicide in bipolar disorders: a systematic review of the literature, Bipolar Disorders, 15, 5, pp. 457-490, (2013); Brady RO, Keshavan M., Emergent treatments based on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder: A selective review, Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 18, pp. 15-21, (2015); Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L., Suicide risk and treatments for patients with bipolar disorder, JAMA, 290, 11, pp. 1517-1519, (2003); Novick D, Swartz HA, Frank E., Suicide attempts in bipolar I and bipolar II disorder: a review and meta-analysis of the evidence, Bipolar Disorders, 12, 1, pp. 1-9, (2010); Amerio A, Russo D, Miletto N, Aguglia A, Costanza A, Benatti B, Et al., Polypharmacy as maintenance treatment in bipolar illness: A systematic review, Acta Psychiatr Scand, 144, 3, pp. 259-276, (2021); Deutschenbaur L, Beck J, Kiyhankhadiv A, Muhlhauser M, Borgwardt S, Walter M, Et al., Role of calcium, glutamate and NMDA in major depression and therapeutic application, Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 64, pp. 325-333, (2016); Szewczyk B, Palucha-Poniewiera A, Poleszak E, Pilc A, Nowak G., Investigational NMDA receptor modulators for depression, Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 21, 1, pp. 91-102, (2012); Kemp JA, McKernan RM., NMDA receptor pathways as drug targets, Nat Neurosci, 5, pp. 1039-1042, (2002); Wolfson P, Hartelius G., The Ketamine Papers, (2016); Alberich S, Martinez-Cengotitabengoa M, Lopez P, Zorrilla I, Nunez N, Vieta E, Et al., Efficacy and safety of ketamine in bipolar depression: A systematic review, Revista de Psiquiatría y Salud Mental (English Edition), 10, 2, pp. 104-112, (2017); Murrough JW, Soleimani L, DeWilde KE, Collins KA, Lapidus KA, Iacoviello BM, Et al., Ketamine for rapid reduction of suicidal ideation: a randomized controlled trial, Psychol.

In addition to meeting criteria for PTSD, patients endorse prominent dissociative symptoms, namely depersonalization and derealization, or detachment from one's self and surroundings. At present, this population is supported by a highly heterogeneous and undeveloped literature. Targeted interventions are therefore lacking, and those indicated for PTSD are limited by poor efficacy, delayed onset of action, and low patient engagement. Here, we introduce cannabis-assisted psychotherapy (CAP) as a novel treatment for D-PTSD, drawing parallels to psychedelic therapy. Case presentation: A 28-year-old female presented with complex D-PTSD. In a naturalistic setting, she underwent 10 sessions of CAP, scheduled twice monthly over 5 months, coupled with integrative cognitive behavioral therapy. An autonomic and relational approach to CAP was leveraged, specifically psychedelic somatic interactional psychotherapy. Acute effects included oceanic boundlessness, ego dissolution, and emotional breakthrough. From baseline to post-treatment, the patient showed a 98.5% reduction in pathological dissociation, as measured by the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation, no longer meeting criteria for D-PTSD. This was accompanied by decreased cognitive distractibility and emotional suffering, as well as increased psychosocial functioning. Anecdotally, the patient has sustained improvements for over 2 years to date. Conclusions: There is urgency to identify treatments for D-PTSD. The present case, while inherently limited, underscores the potential of CAP as a therapeutic option, leading to robust and sustained improvement. Subjective effects were comparable to those produced by classic and non-classic psychedelics, such as psilocybin and ketamine. Further research is warranted to explore, establish, and optimize CAP in D-PTSD, and to characterize its role in the pharmacological landscape.

Despite available treatment, less than half of sufferers achieve recovery and approximately a third become chronically ill. Extreme and enduring cases are particularly resistant to first-line treatment, namely antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, and have the highest rate of premature mortality. Here, we demonstrate that in such cases, repeated sessions of ketamine assisted psychotherapy (KAP) is an effective treatment alternative for improving symptoms. Case Presentation: A 21-year-old woman presented with extreme and enduring bulimia nervosa. She reported recurrent binge-eating and purging by self-induced vomiting 40 episodes per day, which proved refractory to both pharmacological and behavioral treatment at the outpatient, residential, and inpatient level. Provided this, her physician recommended repeated KAP as an exploratory and off-label intervention for her eating disorder. The patient underwent three courses of KAP over 3 months, with each course consisting of six sessions scheduled twice weekly. She showed dramatic reductions in binge-eating and purging following the first course of treatment that continued with the second and third. Complete cessation of behavioral symptoms was achieved 3 months post-treatment. Her remission has sustained for over 1 year to date. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of repeated KAP used to treat bulimia nervosa that led to complete and sustained remission, a rare outcome for severe and enduring cases, let alone extreme ones. Additionally, it highlights the degree to which KAP can be tailored at the individual level based on symptom severity and treatment response. While its mechanism of action is unclear, repeated KAP is a promising intervention for bulimia nervosa that warrants future research and clinical practice consideration.

We report on the results of ketamine-assisted intensive outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment of a client with treatment-resistant, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of experiences of racism and childhood sexual abuse. The client’s presenting symptoms included hypervigilance, social avoidance, feelings of hopelessness, and intense recollections. These symptoms impacted all areas of daily functioning. Psychoeducation was provided on how untreated intergenerational trauma, compounded by additional traumatic experiences, potentiated the client’s experience of PTSD and subsequent maladaptive coping mechanisms. Ketamine was administered four times over a 13-day span as an off-label, adjunct to psychotherapy. Therapeutic interventions and orientations utilized were mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP). New skills were obtained in helping the client respond effectively to negative self-talk, catastrophic thinking, and feelings of helplessness. Treatment led to a significant reduction in symptoms after completion of the program, with gains maintained 4 months post-treatment. This case study demonstrates the effective use of ketamine as an adjunct to psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD. © The Author(s) 2021.","cognitive behavioral therapy; functional analytic psychotherapy; ketamine; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychedelics; racial trauma","ketamine; adult; anxiety; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; case report; child abuse; cognitive behavioral therapy; coping behavior; depression; dialectical behavior therapy; eye movement desensitization and reprocessing; female; follow up; functional analytic psychotherapy; genogram; helplessness; human; mental health; microaggression; middle aged; mindfulness; mindfulness based cognitive therapy; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychoeducation; psychophysiologic assessment; psychotherapy; racism; risk assessment; social avoidance behavior","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3","","","Canada Research Chairs","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding from the Canada Research Chairs Program.

This article presents a clinical example of TRD in a patient with a long history of depression and inadequate response to treatment. The prominent feature is the patient’s persistent self-criticism that might have predisposed him to unrelenting depression symptoms, intense anger, self-doubt, and self-disapproval. We explore potential underlying causes for self-criticism, its impact on depression and help-seeking, and plausible treatment approaches. © 2023 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","","Antidepressive Agents; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Humans; Ketamine; Male; Psychotherapy; Self-Assessment; antidepressant agent; ketamine; depression; human; male; psychotherapy; self evaluation; treatment resistant depression","","ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; Antidepressive Agents, ; Ketamine, ","","","Endowment for the Advancement of Psychotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital","Submitted: January 25, 2023; accepted February 24, 2023.
